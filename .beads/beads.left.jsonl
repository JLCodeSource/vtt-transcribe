{"id":"vtt-transcribe-ufr","title":"Fix test isolation: mock sys.stdin.isatty() to prevent false stdin mode activation","description":"After implementing stdin mode detection in main(), 31 existing tests fail because they don't mock sys.stdin.isatty(). This causes stdin mode to activate unexpectedly in test environments. Fix: Add patch('sys.stdin') with isatty.return_value=True to all affected tests in test_cli.py, test_handlers.py, test_main.py, test_diarization.py, test_transcriber.py","notes":"## COMPLETED (2026-02-04)\n\n**Fixed via PR #186**: https://github.com/JLCodeSource/vtt-transcribe/pull/186\n\n### Solution\nAdded autouse fixture `mock_stdin_tty` in conftest.py that mocks sys.stdin.isatty() to return True by default for all tests. This prevents stdin mode from activating in tests unless explicitly mocked otherwise.\n\n### Implementation\n- conftest.py: Added @pytest.fixture(autouse=True) mock_stdin_tty\n- Fixed 31 failing tests across test_cli.py, test_handlers.py, test_main.py, test_diarization.py, test_transcriber.py\n- All tests passing: 247 passed, 6 skipped, 97% coverage maintained\n\n### Additional Work (Session)\n- Created BATS smoke tests for stdin mode (tests/smoke/stdin.bats)\n- Updated CLI help with stdin mode documentation\n- Fixed BATS environment variable issues\n- Optimized Dockerfile for faster rebuilds (170s → 1s)\n- All commits on feature/T075.7-stdin-support-work branch\n\n### Status\nPR #186 merged into feature/T075-docker-cd.
