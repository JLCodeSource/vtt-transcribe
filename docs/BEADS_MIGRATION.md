2. **map_issues_to_beads.py** - Analyze and map issue relationships
3. **migrate_to_beads.py** - Execute migration via bd CLI
4. **verify_migration.py** - Verify migration completed successfully

## GitHub Issues Status

GitHub issues remain open for historical reference. Each issue includes the external reference in beads, allowing cross-referencing between systems.

Future work tracked exclusively in beads using `bd` CLI:
```bash
bd list --ready          # View available work
bd show <issue-id>       # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim   # Claim work
bd close <id>            # Complete work
```

## Next Steps
